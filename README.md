PCR primer diagnostic kits design for Covid-19 (Alpha- Delta- Omicron) in Africa
================================================================================

This was my first Bioinformatics project, I was really happy to be part of it.
The Main goal was to create a general script that generate primers for any disease given that we have sequences for that disease.
But thsi time we wanted to work on Covid-19 especially in Africa.
Hope you enjoy viewing it and I am glad to have any feedbacks :D 

Special Thanks to my fellow team memebers for their hard work:
