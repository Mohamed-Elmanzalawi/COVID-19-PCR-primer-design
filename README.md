# PCR Primer Diagnostic Kits Design for Covid-19 (Alpha- Delta- Omicron) in Africa 🧬🌍

Welcome to our Bioinformatics project dedicated to designing PCR primer diagnostic kits for COVID-19 variants (Alpha, Delta, Omicron) specifically in Africa.

## Project Overview 🚀

This venture marks my first journey into the realm of Bioinformatics, and I couldn't be more thrilled to share it with you. Our primary objective was to craft a versatile script capable of generating primers for any disease, provided we have the relevant sequences. However, this time around, our focus was on the ever-evolving landscape of COVID-19, with a special emphasis on its variants within the African context.

## Project Highlights 🌟

- **Innovation in Action:** Witness the application of cutting-edge bioinformatics techniques in the development of diagnostic tools for a critical global health challenge.

- **Script Power:** Explore the inner workings of our general-purpose script designed to generate primers, offering a glimpse into the magic behind disease-specific kit creation.

## Enjoy the Journey 🌐

Take a tour through our project, and I hope you find the exploration of PCR primer design both insightful and enjoyable. Your feedback is not just welcome; it's eagerly anticipated! 😃
